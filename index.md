## Welcome!

I am a doctoral candidate in the Department of Biostatistics at the University of California, Los Angeles. My [research](research.md) addresses the statistical challenges that arise in highly structured data. Prior to becoming a Bruin, I received a BA in Biochemistry from Columbia University. Outside of work I love to run, travel, and cook! For more information, please see my [cv](Aaron_Scheffler_CV.pdf].
