## Welcome!

I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Epidemiology & Biostatistics](https://epibiostat.ucsf.edu/) at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). My [research](research.md) addresses the statistical challenges that arise in highly structured data generated in biomedical activities such as imaging. Prior to my arrival at UCSF, I received a doctorate from the Department of Biostatistics at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) and a BA in Biochemistry from Columbia University. For more information, please see my [CV](Aaron_Scheffler_CV.pdf).
