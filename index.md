## Welcome!

I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Epidemiology & Biostatistics](https://profiles.ucsf.edu/aaron.scheffler) at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). My independent [research](research.md) program addresses the statistical challenges that arise in highly structured data generated in biomedical activities such as imaging. This includes joint models of multi-modal brain images, high-dimensional regressions, functional data analysis, and curve registration and warping. I am a core statistician for several centers at the UCSF Memory and Aging Center including the Alzheimerâ€™s Disease Research Center and the ALBA Language Neurobiology laboratory. In addition, I maintain a wide set of collaborations with clinical and public health researchers at UCSF in the area neurology, orthopedics, and HIV/AIDS. Prior to my arrival at UCSF, I received a doctorate from the Department of Biostatistics at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) under the advisement of [Dr. Damla Senturk](https://ph.ucla.edu/about/faculty-staff-directory/damla-senturk) and a BA in Biochemistry from Columbia University. 

My methodological research is sponsored by extramural grants from the __National Institutes of Health Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke__ and the __National Science Foundation (Division of Mathematical Sciences)__.
