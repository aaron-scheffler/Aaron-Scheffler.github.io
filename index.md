## Welcome!

I am a doctoral candidate in the Department of Biostatistics at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). My [research](research.md) addresses the statistical challenges that arise in highly structured data. Prior to attending UCLA, I received a BA in Biochemistry from Columbia University. For more information, please see my [CV](Aaron_Scheffler_CV.pdf).
